 - 'One tradition, dubbed by Clark (1992) as the ‘‘language-as-action’’ tradition, focuses on spoken language processing in interactive settings, with real-world referents and clearly defined behavioral goals, using largely off-line methods. The other tradition, which Clark (1992) dubs the ‘‘language-as-product’’ tradition, uses response measures that are closely time-locked to the linguistic input in order to develop and evaluate detailed mechanistic processing models, using largely decontextualized language in which participants are told to ‘‘comprehend’’ the linguistic input, but not actually use it for a goal-directed behavior.' (Spivey, 2002)
 

 - 'Cooper (1974) demonstrated thateye movements to pictures are closely time-locked to relevant informationin a spoken story.' (Spivey, 2002)
 

 - 'Crain and Steedman (1985) proposed that the preference for an argumentarises due to nonlocal discourse factors interacting with linguistic presuppositions. In particular, given that a definite noun phrase presupposes the existenceof a unique entity, modifying a definite noun phrase is most felicitouswhen the referent would otherwise not be unique in some domain, i.e., whenthere is more than one apple in the context. Crain and Steedman argued thatlisteners initially compute parallel structures and then make the simplestassumption necessary to integrate the linguistic input into a continuouslyupdated discourse model. Simplicity was defined in terms of new presuppositions.' (Spivey, 2002)
 

 - 'When there are two potential referents for a word or phrase in a visual context,there is clear evidence that (1) the probability of fixating one of the candidatereferents at a particular point in time is related to the linguistic evidencefor that referent and (2) the presence of a potential competitor delays fixationsto the correct referent, suggesting that the alternatives are competingwith one another.' (Spivey, 2002)
 

 - Spivey, 2002, is a great ressource to read up on different possible analyses using eyetracking data.
 

 - 'the context was available to be interrogatedby participants as the instruction unfolded, and it was clearly relevant totheir behavioral goals. We assumed that listeners would shift their attentionto objects that became relevant as the instruction unfolded. Attentionalshifts are typically accompanied by a saccadic eye movement to the attendedlocation in space (Hoffman, 1998), and many of the same cortical regions areinvolved in the two processes (Corbetta et al., 1998). Thus, eye movementsare likely to be closely time-locked to comprehension processes.' (Spivey, 2002)
 

 - 'the comparisons of the two-referent and one-referent contexts in Tanenhauset al. (1995) and Trueswell et al. (1999) were insufficient to rule out the possibilitythat the effect of a temporary garden path on eye movements wasmasked by inhibition from potential eye movements to an alternative referent' (Spivey, 2002)
 

 - 'the mapping of referential expressions to a visualmodel is initiated on the basis of extremely partial information, beginning well before the offset of the referring word, and can be modulated by avariety of information sources such as lexical frequency (Dahan et al.,2001), prosodic information (Dahan et al., 2000; Sedivy et al., 1995), verb-based semantic constraints (Chambers et al., 2000) [;] commitments about mapping linguistic expressions to entities in thevisual model can even be made entirely prior to the onset of the referentialexpression itself, provided the verb-based information and visual contextare sufficiently constraining' (Sedivy, 2003)
 

 - 'If interpretation of the referential expression the large red rectangular blockis undertaken incrementally, the properties of the other blocks in the array will determine the degree of indeterminacy involved in processing the instruction.' (Sedivy, 1999)
 

 - 'The Eberhard et al. study provides direct evidence for a view of language processingin which incremental referential processing is central, a view described by Altmann and Steedman (1988) below: The process of incremental evaluation involves having available representationsof ‘partially evaluated’ referents. These are simply the members of theset of referents which satisfy the available constraints. This set gradually becomes more and more refined as the analysis proceeds, until just the candidate referent remains (Altmann and Steedman, 1988, p. 196).' (Sedivy, 1999)
 

 - 'We doubt that Altmann and Steedman’s suggestion will prove to be adequate. It may be attractive to think in terms of progressively narrowing sets ofreferents for NPs with possible post-nominal modifiers. However, referentialnarrowing is far less plausible for other syntactic categories. To make just oneargument, consider adjectival modifiers. The interpretation of an adjective (e.g. ‘red’) generally depends upon its head noun (compare ‘red hair’ and‘red truck’). As an extreme case, consider the adjectives ‘good’ and ‘big’and ‘fake’. These adjectives do not permit narrowing of the set of referents prior to the receipt of their head noun (Clifton and Ferreira, 1989, p. 86).' (Sedivy, 1999)
 

 - 'Display time was manipulated because it was hypothesized that the relativeeffects of typicality and contrast would differ as a function of familiarity with themodel. This is because an effect of typicality is related to the use of stored norms forobject categories, whereas an effect of contrast is related to the presence of entitiesin the model that satisfy presuppositions associated with modifiers. Thus, we mightexpect contrast effects to be stronger, and typicality effects to be weaker in a taskthat allows subjects plenty of time to become familiar with the model.' (Sedivy, 1999)
 

 - 'a set of experimental visual displays were constructed, such that for half of the displays the target object reflected a good fit with a description that involved a scalar adjective (good token), and for the remaining half, the target object reflected a poor fit (poor token). We will refer to this manipulation as the typicality manipulation';'there was a main effect of typicality in the predicted direction as well, with good tokens yielding shorter latencies than poor tokens [...]. In addition, the interaction of contrast and typicality was marginal by subjects, though not by items [...], such that the typicality effect was stronger for displays without contrast than for displays with contrast.' (Sedivy, 1999)
 

 - 'The earliness of looks to the competitor suggests two things. First it suggests thatsubjects were not waiting until the head noun to begin processing adjectival meanings,but were beginning to assign an interpretation immediately. Second, the information available in the displays regarding the presence of a contrasting object wasused extremely early as well, evident in the low occurrence of looks to the competitor for displays with a contrast. Thus, information about the various objects in thedisplay was being used in conjunction with knowledge of the contrastive function ofthe adjective as the subject heard the adjective itself. [...] What emerges from the eye movement data is clear evidence that subjects aresensitive to the contrastive use of the adjectives, and that this information is used incrementally, in such a way as to affect early interpretation of the vague scalar adjective. This is evident in faster eye movement latencies to the target object, thelack of a competitor effect in displays containing a contrasting object and the prevalence of looks to the contrasting object when the display had one. In comparison,the effects of typicality are surprisingly subtle, particularly given the stability ofjudgments in the rating task. They emerge most clearly in displays with no contrasting object present, and are strikingly weak for displays with contrast.' (Sedivy, 1999)
 

 - 'The results indicated that in the absence of a contrastingobject, subjects were very sensitive to the typicality manipulations, as would be expected on the basis of the rating study. However, in the presence of a contrasting object, the typicality effect was reduced.' (Sedivy, 1999)
 

 - 'What is not conclusive fromthe present study, is whether contextually-based effects of contrast with nominal modifiers are most effectively accounted for via inferred conversational implicatures,by means of presuppositional properties of modifiers, as argued by proponents of the Referential Theory, or by the specific contrastive requirements of scalaradjectives.' (Sedivy, 1999)
 

 - Summary of Sedivy, 1999: 'present. These data suggest that when faced with a choicebetween a contrastive and noncontrastive interpretation of an adjective, participants systematically preferred the contrastive interpretation. Strikingly,this preference emerged within hundreds of milliseconds of the onset of the adjective, indicating extremely rapid use of the model-based information inmapping the referential phrase to its referent.' (Sedivy, 2003)
 

 - 'Although the results of the study above appear to support a view ofmodification as broadly contrastive, there are reasons to doubt this account. [...] Most seriously, however, further recent investigations with adjectives reveal that the effect of referential contrast does not extend to alladjective types. In particular, similar experiments involving color adjectivesfail to show a preference for a contrastive interpretation, with no detectable advantage coming from the presence of a contrasting object to the target(Sedivy, in press).' (Sedivy, 2003)
 

 - 'An alternative account of the relationship between linguistic form and contextual information is one in which the context effects can be driven bynonlinguistic knowledge. For instance, Ferreira and Clifton (1989) providean explanation for the typical contrastive function of modifiers in this vein;they propose that it derives from general communicative expectations suchas those outlined by Grice (1975), in which hearers may reasonably assumethat speakers will plan their utterances to be optimally informative. However, Ferreira and Clifton view it as unlikely that such inferential mechanisms are implicated in on-line language processing due to their computational intractability. For the remainder of this section, I will summarize experimental results suggesting that such mechanisms may indeed beinvolved in the incremental processing of language.' (Sedivy, 2003)

 - 'What seemed to distinguish those adjectives [i.e., material vs. size vs. color] which exhibited a contrast effect (i.e., scalar and material adjectives) from the class of adjectives that did not, rather, was the frequency with which that particular type of adjective was spontaneously generated to describe an object in a context where no modification was required to distinguish it from other objects in the visual context. [...] The linking of on-line effects of referential contrast with the rarity of encountering an adjective as part of the typical means of describing the object suggests that the processing mechanism may indeed be driven by general communicative expectations; it is precisely in those situations where the speaker produces more information than is usual (by producing either a scalar or material adjective) that the hearer attributes some particular discourse-based motive for its use and understands the adjective as being present for the purpose of providing referential disambiguation. 
An interesting prediction follows from this view: If referential contrast effects originate in expectations regarding usual or default descriptions rather than in the semantics of the adjectives themselves, it should be possible to empirically dissociate adjectival type from expectations of informativity. Thus, if there are circumstances under which the default description of an object would not include a color adjective, then we would expect the use of a color adjective in these circumstances to trigger an inference of contrastive function.' (Sedivy, 2003)

- 'contrastive interpretations associated with prenominal adjectives are driven by the informational status of the adjective, and not its lexical type [. The] amount of information that is provided
in the instruction exceeds the expected amount of information' (Sedivy, 2003)
