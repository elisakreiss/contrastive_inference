## Norming studies

### Feature list (for color diagnosticity)

- Goal: determine color diagnosticity
	- Is color a property that is closely associated with the object?
	- If a color is mentioned, do participants agree on the color?
- Question: "List 3 perceptual features that describe the object"

### Object naming norming

- Goal: Are the image depictions we chose nameable, the way we intended?
- Question: "What is this?"

### Typicality norming

- Goal: Does the color manipulation of the images show the desired difference in typicality ratings?
- Question: "How typical is this object for an **X**?" (X being for example **banana**)

### OMP (out-of-context modifier probability)
- Goal: Do we refer to objects with in an atypical color differently (when presented *without* other objects in a context)?

##### Free production
- Question: "What is this?"

##### Multiple choice
- Question: "How would you most naturally describe this object?"

##### Speech
- Question: "..."
