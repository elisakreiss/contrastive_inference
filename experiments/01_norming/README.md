### Color diagnosticity

1) List 3 perceptual features that describe the object

2) List typical color for each object

3) Picture norming: How typical is this object for a X *(e.g., banana)*? (typical and atypical stimuli)

### OMP

Name the object (outside of context)! (typical and atypical stimuli)
