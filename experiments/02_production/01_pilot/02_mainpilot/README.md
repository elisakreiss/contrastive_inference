Demo of interactive experiments with \_magpie.

Online demo available [here](https://color-reference.netlify.com/). You need to open the link twice, because it is a game for 2 players.

To run the demo:

-   Clone the repo
-   `npm install`
-   Open `index.html` in your browser
-   Open `index.html` in another browser tab
-   Now one tab should be assigned the speaker role and another the listener role
