### Context creation and selection

##### Stimuli

- conditions: 8 
	- 2 (target typicality) x 2 (competitor typicality) x 2 (contrast presence) design 
- stimuli: 10 objects (each in a typical and atypical color)
	- i.e., 5 colors (each with 2 typically and 2 atypically colored objects)
	- i.e., 20 items
- total number of critical contexts: 80
	- 8 conditions * 10 objects (typicality is already included in conditions)
- each context consists of 4 objects: target, color competitor, optionally a contrast and then filled up with "random" distractors
	- random distractors do not have the same color as any of the other objects in the display and be of a different type

##### Procedure

- every participant goes through 55 trials/contexts (20 critical, 35 fillers; 30 contain modified and 25 contain unmodified utterances)
- critical trials
	- = trials with contexts that are of interest (are in compliance with the conditions and in the comprehension experiments combined with a color modified referring expression)
	- 2 measures of splitting the set (from 80 to 20 critical trials per participant)
		- 1) color competitor typicality is between subject manipulation, resulting in a 2 x 2 design (4 conditions) (80 -> 40)
		- 2) don’t use all 10 objects but only one object for each color drawn randomly for each condition
			- each of the 5 colors contributes 16 critical contexts (two for each condition, because each color has two typical and two atypical objects); consider condition **tap** (typical target, atypical competitor and contrast present) in color yellow, then this can be realized with two different targets (banana and corn), i.e., *yellow banana, yellow strawberry, orange banana* and *yellow corn, yellow strawberry, red corn*; participants will only see one of the two (selected randomly) as a critical trial
- filler trials
	- = trials that distract from true purpose of the study and to ensure that listeners perceive the speaker as a natural speaker
	- 2 purposes
		- since all critical trials have color modified utterances associated with them, we need to have trials without color modification
		- we need to make sure that targets are not logically derivable (two things that are yellow and two things that are bananas shouldn’t automatically mean that the target is the yellow banana)
	- selection of filler trials
		- they are the left over ones from both splitting measures (i.e., when the critical context for color yellow in condition ttp contained a yellow banana, yellow corn, and an orange banana, the context with yellow corn as “target”, yellow banana and red corn will be in the fillers)
- each participant will see 20 critical trials, and additionally those 35 filler trials:
	- 5x utterance: modified; target: color competitor (choose a context from the left-overs with an atypical color competitor and where there is no contrast present, because that could undermine the contrastive inference effect)
	- 5x utterance: unmodified; target: color competitor (choose a context from the left-overs with a typical color competitor; presence of contrast is here irrelevant)
	- 5x utterance: modified; target: contrast (choose a context where a contrast is present)
    - 20x utterance: unmodified; target: random distractor (taken at random from the left-over contexts, but always making sure that the distractor is typical -- if it's not, generate new distractor)
- all contexts have two objects of the same color in them 
	- minimizes the prior participants could have about the potential target given the context
- incongruent trials, i.e., modified ttn and modified tan contexts, can only occur after trial 15 to avoid priming
