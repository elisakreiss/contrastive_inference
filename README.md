# Production expectations modulate contrastive inference

This is the Github repository for our paper "Production expectations modulate contrastive inference" published at CogSci 2020. This repository contains the experiments and pilots run for this project (in *experiments/*), and the data obtained from these studies (in *data/*). The analysis scripts for the comprehension experiment presented in the CogSci publication can be found in *analyses/03_comprehension/02_main/0102_summary/compr_analysis_CogSci.Rmd* and for the production experiment in *analyses/02_production/02_main/0102_summary/analysis.Rmd*.
The model code is available in *models/02_prodInfRSA/model.Rmd*.
