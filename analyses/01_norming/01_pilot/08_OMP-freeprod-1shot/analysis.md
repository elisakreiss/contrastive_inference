#### Table

##### Overall

Tendency for higher color mention is there but it is driven by carrot (see next table)

    ##           
    ##            type color+type other
    ##   typical    58          0     1
    ##   atypical   44         13     2

##### Carrot

Very nice difference between the typical and the atypical carrot

    ##           
    ##            type color+type other
    ##   typical    30          0     0
    ##   atypical   15         12     2

##### Banana

Essentially no difference between the typical and atypical banana

    ##           
    ##            type color+type other
    ##   typical    28          0     1
    ##   atypical   29          1     0
