CI: object reference pilot analysis
================

Object descriptions
-------------------

#### Graph

When we compare these results to the main free production (non-1shot) study, we can observe a qualitative if not even quantitative replication. For banana, 100% of the referring expressions were type-only utterances. Here, we see a similar pattern. For carrot, almost 100% of the referring expressions for the orange carrot were type-only. This is replicated here. This pilot also replicates the higher proportion of color-type utterances in the atypical carrot case. The effect seems to be slightly bigger, but not remarkably.<br>

In conclusion, the pilot does not seem to provide essentially different results than the main production study.<br>

("other" utterances: green carrot received labels "correct" and "vegetable"; and the yellow banana was referred to with "one ripe banana")

#### Table

##### Overall

Tendency for higher color mention is there but it is driven by carrot (see next table)

    ##           
    ##            type color+type other
    ##   typical    58          0     1
    ##   atypical   44         13     2

##### Carrot

Very nice difference between the typical and the atypical carrot

    ##           
    ##            type color+type other
    ##   typical    30          0     0
    ##   atypical   15         12     2

##### Banana

Essentially no difference between the typical and atypical banana

    ##           
    ##            type color+type other
    ##   typical    28          0     1
    ##   atypical   29          1     0
