# Analyses -- main trials

## Hypotheses

#### There is a general contrast effect (1)
- after adjective: contrast presence increases target selection
- clicks to target ~ contrast presence (on the whole data set after adj mention)

#### There is a typicality effect when there is no contrast (2)
- after adjective: when there is no contrast, there will be more clicks to the target in the atn vs. tan condition
- clicks to target ~ condition (on atn and tan trials after adj mention)
- note: this is like (3), just without contrast
- note: ttn and aan should be random

#### There is a typicality effect when there is a contrast (3)
- after adjective: when there is a contrast, there will be more clicks to the target in the atp vs. tap condition
- clicks to target ~ condition (on atp and tap trials after adj mention)
- note: this is like (2), just with contrast
- note: This is mainly a processing claim for the eyetracking study. If it doesn't manifest itself in clicks, it could be seen through reaction times or number of erroneous clicks/multiple selections after the noun
    - reaction time ~ condition (on atp and tap trials after noun mention)
    - number of errors ~ condition (on atp and tap trials after noun mention; number of errors could be actual errors or multiple selections)

#### Typicality affects contrastive inference (7)
- after adjective: decreased contrastive inference effect between ttn and ttp vs. tan and tap
- clicks to target ~ contrast presence * competitor typicality
- note: this shouldn't be significant in the prior though
- note: what about atn and atp vs. tan and tap? (more extreme)



## Other things to look at / plot

#### Prior (use all main contexts -- critical and filler)
- Is there an overall bias already in the object selection before any linguistic cues? (all contexts)
- Is there a contrast bias, i.e., if a contrast object is present, is it more likely that the target/contrast are selected? (contexts: contrast present)
- Is there a color competitor bias, i.e., are participants more likely to select one of the two objects of the same color? (all contexts)
- Is there a contrastive inference bias, i.e., contrast + competitor bias: if a contrast is present, is it more likely that the target is selected?  (contexts: contrast present)
- Is there an atypicality bias, i.e., is the proportion of clicks on atypical object higher than typical ones? (all contexts)
- Is there a position bias, i.e., is there one position on the grid that is preferred? (all contexts)
- Are all of these patterns stable when we compare the first with the second half of the experiment?

#### After adjective (use only critical contexts)
- What is the proportion of wrongly selected objects (i.e., that are false given the information)?
- Is there a clear pattern difference in the atp context, as opposed to the tan context? (In atp, all cues suggest that the target should be the target; in tan, there might be a slight tendency for the color competitor.)
- Independent of typicality, is there overall a selection bias for the object with the contrast (i.e., the target)? (contexts: ttp,tap,atp,aap)
- Independent of contrast, is there overall a selection bias for the atypically colored object, when target and competitor differ in typicality? (contexts: tap,tan,atp,atn)
- When target and competitor have the same typicality and there is a contrast, is there a selection bias for the object with the contrast (i.e., the target)? (contexts: ttp,aap)
- When contrast is absent and target and competitor differ in typicality, is there an overall selection bias for the atypical object? (contexts: tan,atn)
- What are the overall selection patterns for each condition?
- Are all of these patterns stable when we compare the first with the second half of the experiment?

#### After noun (use only critical contexts)
- What is the proportion of wrongly selected objects?
- Is there a difference in reaction time between the atp and tan context?
- Is there a difference in false selections/multiple selections between the atp and tan context?
- Is there an overall target position bias? (We need this to address the position bias question in the prior, if existent. But for this we also need to consider the fillers and not just the critical trials.)
- Are all of these patterns stable when we compare the first with the second half of the experiment?
- Is there a pattern to where the most errors/multiple selections occur? (dependent on condition?)

#### Overall
- When do most multiple selections occur (prior, after adj, after noun? is there a condition-wise split? a first/second half of trials split?)

#### Other ideas
- would also be interesting to see trials after contexts where assumption was broken
